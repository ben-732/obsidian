Focuses on how to organise data into the form of a tree. 

### Intro / Problem
Consider having a collection of bags
![[Pasted image 20230820151814.png | center | 400]]
if you want to merge bag 1 and 5 , and 8 and 2 you can do this
![[Pasted image 20230820151841.png | center | 400]]

then if you want to merge 3 and 8 so u do this
![[Pasted image 20230820151916.png | center | 400]]
And then you can check if multiple numbers are in the same bag

### Union find Method

#### Fast `isSameBag()`
Maintain an array `bag` which holds a representative of the bag of each number

When you merge two bags together, change the identifier of bags so that they're all the same. 
![[Pasted image 20230820152328.png | center | 400]]
`mergeBags(1, 2)` The identifier of bag 1 is 1 and bag 2 is 2. Change the identifier of all bags with identifier 1 from 1 to 2. making 2 their joint identifier.  

#### Faster `mergeBags()`
Maintain an array `parent` which tells us is if a number is a representative of its bag, and if not,
who to ask about the representative?

Merging: Find the representative of each bag and update a to be represented by b.


##### Problems  
`isSameBag` might be slower now, but at least we (maybe) don't have to iterate through all the numbers when doing `merge`.

Unfortunately, there exists a sequence of calls to `merge` which is **very slow**, however there are also very friendly sequence that is the opposite of the slow sequence. Completely dependant on the order of calls. 

This happens when there is a very long chain created by
```java
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) mergeBags(i, 0)
```
After three iterations it has created this...
![[Pasted image 20230820153327.png | center| 400]]

Here the running time is proportional to the distance to representative of `a` and the distance to representative of `b` in `mergeBags(a, b)`. 

##### Solution
We can solve this by also maintaining an array height such that if a number `x` is a representative of a bag, then `height[x]` is the largest distance from any number in that bag to `x`.

Then every time you merge two bags you do it such that there is no change in height. Link the representative with the smaller `height` value to the one with the larger `height` value. 
![[Pasted image 20230820154514.png | center | 300]]
There are always going to be some cases (when the bags are the same height) where the height increase but this method means this happens as infrequently as possible. 

>[!tip] mAth stuff
>If `x` is a representative, then its bag contains at least $2^{\text{height}[x]}$ numbers

> This implies that $\text{height}[x] \leq \log(n)$. So therefore every node as at most $\log n$ from its representative / parent. 

##### Solution - Fast find
Use something called **Path Compression**
This means that when you use find, it updates the references to tell them to point straight to the representative rather than just their immediate parent.

###### Time complexity
The amortised [[2. Time Complexity|time complexity]] of this is $\log^*n$ known as log star.

where $2^{2^{2^{2^{2}}}} = 2^{65536}$
