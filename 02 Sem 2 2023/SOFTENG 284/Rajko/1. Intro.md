### Secret number thing
```python
for k in range(1, 100):
	Ask "Is the number larger than K ?"
	if "No" then return K

return 100
```

This approach is really good if we have a low number, but if we are unlucky and have  a number like 99, it is bad. 

Focusing on if we are **unlucky**

> The efficiency of a strategy is determined by its worst performance. 

#### Improved strategy
Guessing number in the middle of the range of possible answers

```python
left = 1, right = n
while(left < right):
	K = # a number in the middle of left and right
	Ask "Is the number larger than k"
	if "No" then right = K
	else left = K + 1
return left
```

- In each iteration, the number of candidates (roughly) halves
- the efficiency can be described as $log \ n$
- You solve the problem by halving it 
- This is an example of binary search

##### Problems:
Picking a middle between two integers is vague. In our description we want elementary steps in the description. `floor( (left + right) / 2 )`
