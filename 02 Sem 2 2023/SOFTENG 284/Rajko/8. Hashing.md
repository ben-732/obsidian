Hashing function/table, collisions, hashing function choice, collision resolution (chaining, open addressing), hashing analysis, universal hashing



### Hash Tables
Hash tables work by storing elements whose index is their "key" retrieved by preforming a hash operation on the original object. 

When two elements have the same key collisions occur. 

#### Collisions
There are two main ways of resolving collisions, chaining and open addressing. 

##### Chaining
Chaining works by creating a linked list at each position in the overall "array". You add elements to the linked list at the appropriate index.

While this works, it has a theoretical maximum time complexity of $O(n)$ in the situation where all elements have the same hash and you end up with effectively one linked list of length $n$

This however won't happen in practice. (Something to do with how large $m$ is) 

M is ideally not much bigger than the numer of added elements. 

##### Open addressing
Choose another address for the object based on the original address, you can use +1 one for this but it has issues in the form of grouping. 



When removing an element, you need to mark it as *deleted* rather than just empty otherwise the algorithm will stop looking at the *empty* cell in the future and potentially miss something that is there. 

**Load Factor $\alpha$** = number of elements in the table divided by the size of the table. 
As load factor increases, we will get more collisions, when it gets to 1 then we cannot take any more elements. The solution to this is "when load factor becomes large â€“ resize the table and re-insert everything"


**Probing** refers to the way in which you choose the next address to try and can minimise the grouping problem. 
###### Linear Probing

Linear probing can be dangerous because of buckets and clustering. 


###### Quadratic Probing
This solves the problem of clustering by spacing out elements by using the equation
$$
\text{hash}(x) + C_{1} \cdot p + C_{2} \cdot p \, \text{  mod}(m)
$$
Where $C_{1}, C_{2}$ are constants we choose and $p$ refers to the number place were looking at, 1,2 etc.

here $C_{1}=0,C_{2}=1$

A good choice for the values of the constants for when $m = 2^t$ is $C_{1}=C_{2}=\frac{1}{2}$ because it is guaranteed to visit every bucket of the hash table

###### Double hashing
Not really covered but it is where on the $k$-th step you try to incorporate the reliance of $h$ on $x$

### A good hash function
Why $h(x) = x \,\% \,2^m$  is a bad hash function:


We use $31$ as it is not a 2^x value so it distributes the bits better, and you don't loose information when you do the modulus $2^{32}$

If you used $x = 32$ and $m = 2^{32}$ to hash strings then the last characters of the string would determine the entirety of the hash, meaning that *temperature* and *literature* would have the same hash. This is bad as we want to reduce collisions and this would cause a lot of collisions.  

#### Demonstration thing
$32 = 2^5$

Because on each iteration of the hash function, we effectively multiply by $32^{i-1}$ this means we multiple by $2^{5\cdot (i-1)}$ this means that as soon as $i\geq7$ then you are multiplying by something $\geq 2^{5*7} = 2^{35}$. This is a problem because you then go and modulus by $m=2^{32}$ so you are immediately loosing everything to the mod function as $2^{35} = 2^{32}\times 2^3$ therefore by modulus rules, $0 = 2^{32}\text{ mod } 2^{32} \equiv 2^{32}\times a \text{ mod } 2^{32}$ where $a$ is any positive integer.
