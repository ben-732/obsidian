### Sorting in practice (java)
`java.utils.arrays.sort()` 
the generic sort function in java.

Most sort functions on [[Advanced Data Structures|advanced data structures]] reference this sort function

Is guaranteed to be stable with a $O(n\log n)$ worst case running time.

#### What algorithm is used?
This is dependant on what you are trying to sort. 
##### Bytes
Insertion or Counting sort. Dependant on the size of the array.

If the array is short, (< `MIN_BYTE_COUNTING_SORT_SIZE` (64)) insertion sort is used. Otherwise counting sort is used. 

##### Integers
- Dual Pivot Quicksort (with tail recursion)
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
	- Clever implementation of selection sort

##### Objects
TimSort - Heavily engineered hybrid [[4. Sorting#Merge Sort|MergeSort]]

Originally invaded for the standard python library

insertion sort in timsort

- Find the right position to insert a element using binary search
- Comparison are expensive in objects

#### Conclusion
Sorting in java uses everything we have learnt in sorting. They are all engineered so that the worst case is $O(n\log n)$ however, in a real world application that is getting used a lot, that worst possible case is still going to get hit no matter regularly no matter the probability. 

There are lots of low level optimisations that go on to try reduce the time to sort. 

Having an efficient algorithm in terms of big O is just the first step!
### Sorting by comparison
So far we have bene sorting integers, but all we did was compare them (<, >, =)

We could then as well as sort an array of Objects, assuming:
- Each elelemtn ==sddsfsdf==

### Can we do sorting in $O(n)$
- Insertion/Selection Sort $O(n^2)$
- Merge / Randomised quicksort $O(n\log n)$

Can you sort in linear time?
Short answer: **no\***

If all you can do is compare things to each other.

#### Sorting Bytes
#implementable
Idea: Count how many times each number appears in the array,  then reconstruct the array with the correct order. 

This is good when sorting bytes as there are only 256 possible values. Integers however are much larger than this `32 bits`

==Implement this somehow ==

### Aspects of sorting algorithms
- Running time
- I sit in place?
	- do we need a lot of extra memory
- Is it stable?
	- If two elements are equal, their order should be preserved. 
	- Only makes sense when sorting complex objects

### Counting sort (revised)
```java
class Element {
	public int type;
	public String name;
}
```

Count how many elements of each type we have

Use a next position array to store the next position for elements of each type. 

This sorting stable but cannot be done in place

#### Radix Sort
#implementable
Sorting of integers by sorting by digits
Start by sorting on least significant digit. Use a stable sorting algorithm so that previous sorting is not undone. 

Move through digits towards most significant digit sorting the array. 

### Sorting summary
![[Pasted image 20230802135227.png | center| 400]]

**In place**: do we need a lot of extra memory? If yes - then it is not in place. 
**Stable**: If two elements are equal, their order should be preserved. 

#### Quick sort, In place or not?
```java
void quicksort(int A[], int start, int end) {
	if (start >= end)  return;

	int q = partition(A, start, end);
	quicksort(A, start, q-1);
	quicksort(A, q+1, end);
}
```

If you ran this function with a high `n` value, you would encounter stack over-flow

> Additional memory you use is at worst $O(n)$ meaning that it is not in place. 

There is a technique to avoid this called *tail-recursion* which if implemented correcntly garuntees that the recursion depth is never more than $\log n$
