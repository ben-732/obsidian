### Overview

### Question 1 - What do you mean by one round of the game should last two minutes
We think that the entire game, like to escape the room should take two minutes. 


We think these should be quick riddles, like our clients don't want to sit and spend half an hour to escape. Our argument is that even with only two minutes, you can challenge yourself.

### Are you sure you want to 

We do want to use gpt - its two fold. 

We want to incorporate AI, our business wants to use it while its popular

Our company wants to provide a more personalised experience than what we are able to create at the moment. All our users have different requirements as to their required difficulty etc 

++ openai gpt-3 has been researched and we like ?

### Specific theme
No specific theme that were set on, willing to hear different ideas as they're proposed. Broad audience range will have their own natural themes that will attract them. ,

At this stage, while the application is still being developed, they are still willing to be open to the variety. 

### What values would you...

As a business the values that were trying to promote are broad. 

Younger generation: developing confidence, creativity etc. 
Older generation: improve socialisation, memory retention

### Screen size
> The size of ~600x400 is limiting, are you concerned about this for mobile users, and also expand so to fit more information

Initial code is a prototype from another group of developers that abandoned the project, we can use as much of, or as little of as we want. 

### What was the plan of the original developers
It was a similar mission, it was with an inexperienced company, they didn't devote the required time required to make the app. The technology was also very new at the time and it was more of a feasibility study for them. 

### The tone of the product
While we said we had a broad audience, that was more us as a business, this product is not expected to cater for everyone. We are more than happy for you to pick a smaller audience and cater to them. 

Choose something that matches your strength etc etc 


### Specific things in the past
The other developers have not understood our vision. We know it was not meant to be a prototype, but it was very limited.
