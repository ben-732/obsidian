#### Why Presentation skills
- ﻿Presentations may have a large influence on a particular outcome
- ﻿﻿It is a skill that needs to be studied and practiced
- ﻿﻿Visceral fear with delivery

#### Misconceptions addressed
- ﻿﻿Your slides are not your presentation
- ﻿﻿Content is still king
- ﻿﻿Communication and performance
- ﻿﻿Standing ovation myth

### Content
Why does the audience care about the message? You're trying to change the way that they think so why should they listen to you.

### AIMER Framework
#### Audience
- It is not about you
- Keep the focus on the audience

**Demographics:** There are different demographics who you need to account for
- Bigger audiences are usually more diverse and have less technical knowledge
- If you don't know, choose a target audience

**Knowledge:** Technical, commercial, political and lay audiences
- Presentations should have little technical detail

**Expectations:** What is expected of the presentation and why is it needed
- Is it going to be an argument? discussion? etc

**Attitude:** What is their attitude, Tends to be more neutral?

**Engagement:** When and where is the presentation, how can you keep them engaged?

#### Intention
What are you trying to do with your presentation?

**Context:**
- Educate
	- Sending a message, not teaching
- Persuade
- Inspire
- Entertain
- Summarise (like a report)

Impactful presentations often have a combination of these different contexts

**Change:** How are you going to change the way they think, feel and/or behave
**Value:** What is in it for them?
**Personal Goal:** What is your goal? What do you want to achieve by communicating?

#### Message
What is your take-home message? This needs to be brief, no more than one sentence. 

>[!info] People will only remember one thing

- Makes it clear for the audience and makes it clear for you what your presentation is about
- Only ONE take-home message for a presentation
- "Things happen when you put yourself out there"
- Make it more memorable using **SCREAM** rhetorical devices
	- ﻿**Simile** (uses like): "Learn like a scientist".
	- ﻿﻿**Contrast**: "If you put yourself up, you let your audience down", "With great power.."
	- ﻿﻿**Rhyme**: "Your niche will make you rich".
	- ﻿﻿**Echo** (repetition): "If you squeeze your information in, you squeeze your audience out".
	- ﻿﻿**Alliteration**: "Being wrong is not a sign of weakness; it's a sign of wisdom".
	- ﻿﻿**Metaphor**: "Goals are the key to success"
#### Explain
**Brainstorm & Research:** Anything relevant including analysis, experiments, points, stories, analogies, acronyms, facts, statistics, visuals, publications, rhetorical questions, audience interactions.. 
- Engineers and scientists tend to target only the head with facts
- Try to turn your data into something appealing, put it in context "this energy could like 150k homes"

**Select information:** Select the information that directly supports your take-home message
-  Presentations summarise information
- LESS IS MORE, simplify and do not confuse
- If you squeeze information in, you squeeze your audience out. 

**Structure information:** Introduction, body and conclusion
- Introduction: 
	- ﻿﻿Hook/attention grabber
	- ﻿﻿Take-home message
	- ﻿﻿Agenda
	- ﻿﻿WIIFM
- Body:
	- Supporting material
	- 3-5 main supporting points
	- Facts, statistics, stories, analogies, visuals, interaction...
- Conclusion
	- Summary: take-home message and main supporting  points  
	- Call to action

**Visual Aides:** Create a visual aide to go alongside your presentation
- You can write the whole script or just go with the outline  
-  Add in all the tools to make the presentation more engaging such as rhetorical questions, stories, analogies, interaction with the audience...  
-  Now that you know what you are going to say, prepare slides

>[!info] The slides are not the presentation, just visual aids
##### Different Structures
1. Statement and supporting points to convey an opinion  
2. Research presentation (establish relevance of your science for the audience, question,  hypothesis, conclusion; if you have time add results and method)  
3. Chronological order for simple, ordered instructions or reports  
4. Problem, solution, risks  
5. Current situation and proposed situation  
6. Inductive format (general to specific) or deductive format (specific to general)  
7. Pros and cons (or compare and contrast) for simple analyses or evaluations  
8. Decision-making format for complex issues (define problem, establish criteria, identify  possible solutions, evaluate solutions, select best solution, discuss implementation)  
9. PAR format for problem, action, result (job interview response)  
	- Appeals to peoples emotional side?
10. STARR format for situation, task, action, results and recommendations  DIFFERENT STRUCTURES




##### Designing visual aides
- Visual, not text (graphs, pictures, diagrams, images)  
- Simple  
- For busy slides present the information in chunks  
	- Force people to focus on what you want them to
- Font can be read (28), minimum size (18), font cannot be easily read (12)  
- Ideally, do not use the slide as a prompter 
- Walk the audience through graphs

>[!danger] Visuals, not text!  


#### Review (and Rehearse)
**Rehearse by yourself:** Say it out loud, ideally at least 3 times. Do not memorise, a strong structure makes it easier to remember.

**Get feedback:** rehearse in front of someone else. Do they understand, care, and remember? Is the take-home message clear? Is it engaging? 

**Iteration:** improve anything that can be improved, the intention, the take- home message, the information that supports it.

### Engaging delivery
>[!tip] Preparation > Content > Confidence > Delivery

A Presentation is part of a *performance*
- Voice
	- ﻿Variation in pitch
	- ﻿﻿Variation in pace
	- ﻿﻿No verba fillers
	- ﻿﻿Use of pauses
	- **Avoid being monotonous**
- Eye Contact
	- Engages the audience
		- Everyone wants attention
	- This can be difficult to do well
	- Look around the room
	- Wait for acknowledgement and then move to a different section of the audience
- Body Language
	- Stance
	- Stable, feet slightly apart
	- No leaning
	- Open body language shows confidence
- Energy Levels

#### Online Presentations
- Voice
- Face Gestures
- Some hand gestures
- Watch how your head is tilted
