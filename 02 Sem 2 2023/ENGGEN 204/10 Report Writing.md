Why report writing?
- ﻿Engineers spent 30-90% of their time doing technical writing
- ﻿﻿ENGGEN 303 and 403 both have lots of writing
- ﻿﻿Your 4th year project will need you to write a report

Report writing is very personal, everyone has there own approach and there is not one right way.
### Typical structure:
A report normally consists of the following parts, following Wai's (lecturers) method

- ﻿﻿Title/cover page
- ﻿﻿Executive summary
- ﻿﻿Table of contents
- ﻿﻿Introduction (includes background, aims, and introduces the whole report)
- ﻿﻿Procedure/method
- ﻿﻿Findings results
- ﻿﻿Analysis/Discussion
- ﻿﻿Conclusions (no new information)
- ﻿﻿Recommendations
- ﻿﻿References/bibliography
- ﻿﻿Appendices (if you expect reader to read it shouldn't go in the appendix)

#### Order
##### Writing the introduction first:
- Helps you layout the background and the context for the report  
- Forces you to think about the audience
- Helps you to crystallize the message and purpose of the report  
- You are already indirectly ‘implying’ the conclusion (or your stance)

##### Writing the conclusion/recommendation second:
- Firms up the boundary and scope of the report  
- Even further crystallises the message!  
- I do not even have the report ... how do I conclude?

After the conclusion, start working up adding supporting arguments

##### Think about the discussion / Analysis
- May be useful to structure them into headings/sub‐headings  
- What components/arguments are required to reach the conclusion?  
- What order so that it is logical and ‘appealing’?
- You need a problem for your report to be appealing

##### Think about the results
- Put on data (and in the right form) to support your discussion  
- Do not need to put all the data  
- What do I do with all the extra raw data?
- The appendix will not be read probably. 

##### The rest of the report
- Title/cover page  
- Executive summary  
- Table of contents  
- Procedure/method  
- References/bibliography  
- Appendices (if you expect reader to read it shouldn’t go in the appendix)

>[!tip] You may plan these before even starting the project!

### Impactful writing examples

#### Abstract vs Executive summary
An executive summary is more of a brief introduction and an abstract summary is the findings from the whole report. 

The executive summary is broader while the abstract summary is more structured and goes more into detail. q

#### Conclusion things
If you have a strong call for action, you want the readers to be engaged. Marketing things can be good but not always. not just a summary of facts.
