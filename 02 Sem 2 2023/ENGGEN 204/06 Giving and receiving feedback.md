### Feedback

Definition of feedback: information about reactions to a product, a person's performance of a task which is used as a basis for improvement

In collaborative communication, there is a need to encourage and critique so that we can get the best out of our team members. 

Giving feedback is one highly effective way to communicate to team members on how they can improve and more importantly contribute to the team and the team's goal in solving a prescribed problem. 

- Providing feedback helps someone to improve their performance.
- Receiving feedback helps to improve your own performance
- Giving and receiving feedback effectively makes a  good , fair, and ethical team player / leader

There is an expectation that feedback should be given in a constructive manner, being open, empathetic, clear, and supportive. 

### Types of feedback
- Informal
	- In verbal form, on the spot communication
	- Generally referring to an recent demonstration of performance or conduct. 
- Formal
	- Usually in written form. Typically part of a recommended structure or rubric
- Formative
	- Typically less consequential than a summative feedback. There are less stakes involved
	- Feedback is designed to be continuous and progressive along a journey of learning
	- Intended to improve performance in the next task along this journey
- Summative
	- Feedback that constitutes a final assessment or opinion on one's performance overall. 
	- At the end of the Formative journey of learning and collaboration. 

The appropriate type of feedback should be decided by the setting and the scale of conduct/misconduct.

Some types of feedback also work better for getting results sooner or later. 


#### Models of feedback

**Feedback Sandwich** 
where the feedback starts and concludes on a positive note but has a "critique" in the middle.
Pros:
- Softens the impact of the criticism
- Enables ending on a positive note
Cons
- Beware of the critique being lost between the "contrived" compliments
- Its all very great. "but"....

**Chronological Model** 
Pros:
- Good for report style feedback
- A good chance that the feedback will be structures, clear and easily understandable

Cons:
- Not dynamic nor interactive
- Less chance of inviting response or timely discussion
- Quite one sided

**Pendleton Model** 
Constantly asking questions and getting response. Involved more of a conversation and reflection dialog

Pros:
- Faciilitates reflection
- invites the one being reviewed to think about themselves and formulate the improvements

Cons:
- The quality of the outcome is still highly dependent on the skill of the coaching
- It may be too structured and prevent free-flowing discussion  
-  Requires skill and experience  
### Effective Feedback
#### Barriers to effective feedback
- Generalised feedback not related to specifc facts
- Lack of advice on how to improve behaviour
- A lack of respect for the source of feedback
- Fear of upsetting colleagues
- Fear of damaging professional realationships
- Defensive behaviour / resistance when receiving feedback
- Physical barriers: noise, improper time, place or space
- Personal Agendas
- Lack of confidence. 

#### Good feedback
Provide feedback that is concise and succient, being specific and prescriptive
- Stick to the specific issues, and provide some guidance on how to go about improving. 
- Feedback should try to include actionable guidance
- As much as possible, the receiver should have an idea on the actions required to directly improve

To avoid encountering a ‘barrier’ as listed above, the feedback should be referenced or validated as well as can be, for the  
receiver to understand why the feedback is necessary.  
- For example, when giving feedback to a peer who you are collaborating with to solve a problem, it is good to provide feedback that clearly references the problem that needs to be solved by the group.  
Finally, it is mandatory that the feedback be presented in a kind manner and there is empathy and awareness of the feelings and position of the receive


##### Open ended questions 
Good for giving feedback that encourage self reflection
- How do you think things went wrong
- Did it go as planned? if not, why?
-   If you were doing it again, what would you do the same next time and what would you do differently? Why?  
-  How did you feel during the session? How would you feel about doing it again?  
- How do you think the (client) felt? What makes you think that?  
-  What did you learn from this session?
#### Further Considerations
1. Do not bring up past actions unless you wish to underscore a certain behaviour or pattern
2. As a rule. start with the positive then move on to negative events
3. Be aware of non-verbal clues such as you facial expression, body language, poster, voice and eye contact. 
4. Focus your attention on the person in front giving feedback and when you are listening
5. In the end, remember to summarise the session (in an email etc) and to follow up on what has been discussed

### Receiving feedback
Receiving feedback is important. Part of positive maturity and leadership is to know how to receive feedback. The following are some tips on how to receive feedback. 
- Be a good listener
- When in doubt, ask for clarification
- Embrace the feedback session as a learning opportunity
- Remember to pause and think before responding
- Avoid jumping to conclusion
- Show that you are invested in the learning process and keen to improve
- Think positively and be open to helpful hints
