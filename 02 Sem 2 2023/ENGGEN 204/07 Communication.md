Human beings are the result of a long evolutionary development with interaction between our biology and the social and cultural conditions under which this evolution has taken place.  

To succeed, humans cooperate and pool their human capital, and as social animals, human beings use communication techniques and tools, to create and **develop social capital**, and in concert then overcome both the fundamental problems of existence as well as face new challenges that threaten the species.

At a smaller scale, our day to day lives does require a great deal of communication between individuals, to **enable a range of relationships and circumstances to produce the desired outcomes**.  

For example, communication involving negotiation for a purchase or sale, pitching an idea to an investor, conveying accurate and reliable consequential data, winning the heart of a loved one, or simply expressing one’s thoughts for intellectually gainful reflection. 

In terms of language or linguistics, the study of discourse, and their different modes, can help an individual **understand** their own language and its **purpose** better.  

#### Why we need to understand modes of discourse
Akin to an athlete, a good writer/communicator wanting to succeed in an object dependent on how well one communicates, will need to learn and train to be a winning communicator.  

Athletes a systematic in their training, communicators in their training need to be systematic too.

### Four Modes of discourse
**Narrative:** tells a story, giving an account with an obvious ‘start’ and an ‘end’. There is a point to the narration or message.  

**Description:** on the other hand may not have a point, a start and end, and really is about expressing the ‘details’. In so doing, descriptions tend to also invoke the five senses, for example listing smells, moods, and colours.  

**Exposition:** is a form in which the facts, data and the like are reported and informs the reader or listener. It tends to avoid unnecessary details, distinguishing it from a description, and focuses on the important elements that serves the purposes of providing objective and useful information.  

**Argument** refers to linguistics where the intention is to convince or persuade. A good argument is usually backed up with evidence and data.

Each of these modes of discourse have different attributes and are all useful at different times. 
#### Narration
- Tells a story
- Has a start, middle, and a end
- Gives an account
- Makes a point

#### Description
- A form of communication that relies on the five senses to help the audience/reader visualize something
- Lists the appearance, smell, mood, or other characteristics
- Descriptive
- Difference from narrative
	- Details
#### Exposition
- To inform
- Provides facts insights, definitions
- Difference from description
	- Skims details
	- Focuses on important bits

#### Argument
- Purposeful - to convince
- Use evidence and reason

#### Other considerations
Besides the attributes, to qualify these modes of discourse, there are also differences in how ideas are expressed according to the situation, the way the text progresses, the extent of subjectivity or the viewpoint of the writer, and the overall structure. 

- Therefore, in totality, the attributes can refer to whether the mode is dynamic versus static, contains knowledge versus beliefs, anchored in some space or time, or is literal versus metaphoric.  
-  So, for example a narrative is relatively dynamic compared to a description that is more static.  
-  A description would be anchored to space and time, while an argument would be less so and be more metaphorical. However, both description and argument are likely to be subjective

### Objectivity vs Subjectivity
The concepts of objectivity and subjectivity are typically defined relative to each other: if something is not objective, then it is subjective.  

The purpose of objectivity is to ‘guard’ us against subjectivity.  

>"to be objective is to aspire to knowledge that bears no trace of the knower—knowledge unmarked by prejudice or skill, fantasy or judgment, wishing or striving" (Daston and Galison, 2007)

- the terms ‘objectivity’ and ‘subjectivity’ are frequently used with varying degrees of positive and negative  connotations  
- The ways of reasoning are key to determining which is suitable where and when.

Some cases for objectivity include:
- Rule following  
- Value-free  
- Transparent  
- No Biases  
- No Conflicts of Interest  
- Meets the need for reproducibility  
- Reliability  
- Easy for everyone to be ‘on the same page' 
#### Value-free
- Values enter science at several points.  
- They influence the choice of research problem and methods, what starting assumptions are allowed, what modelling strategies are used, what evidence is gathered, the acceptance of a theory or hypothesis as an adequate answer, and the proliferation and application of the results.  
	- Research does not eradicate the personal.  
	- Researchers’ socio-temporal location influences their perception of the social world and the way problems are framed.

#### Evidence based Practice

- An emphasis on seeking reliable knowledge through empirical research can distract focus from the importance of improving the reliability of information, however obtained.  
	- Statistics  
	- Big data  
	- Black box  
- Q: Is the conclusion based on the evidence?  
	- Misinterpretation  
	- Misrepresentation

#### Beware
- A claim to objectivity can imply a claim that anyone who is dissenting has no valid grounds to do so.  
- The importance of inter-personal relationships and empathy.  
- On the requirements of good leadership and good judgement

#### Grades - Levels of Evidence
How to establish standard and guidelines for best practice?  
E.g. lets consider the medical field. The quality or levels of evidence is graded as follows:  
1.  Randomised Controlled Trial  
2.  Non-randomised but very well-designed case-control study  
3.  Time series with evidence showing dramatic results from the introduction of the intervention in an uncontrolled manner. (e.g. Penicillin introduction in WWII)  
4.  Opinions of well respected authorities based on clinical experience, observations etc.

Breaks down into two parts
**Technical**  
• having special and usually practical knowledge especially of a mechanical or scientific subject  
• of or relating to a particular subject  
• based on or marked by a strict or legal interpretation 

**Communication**  
• a process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behaviour  
• information transmitted or conveyed

#### Examples
Some examples of technical communication includes
- User manuals  
- Standard Operating Procedures  
- Patents  
- Technical Reports  
- Research reports  
- Standards and Codes  
- Business Cases  
- Reports to government

### Important Groups
• [Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators](https://istc.org.uk/) (UK – ISTC)  
• [Society for Technical Communication](https://www.stc.org/) (USA)  
• [European Association for Technical Communication](https://www.technical-communication.org/) (EU and known as TEKOM)  
• [Australian Society for Technical Communication](https://www.astc.org.au/) (AUS - ASTC)
### What is technical communication
- Technical communication is the process of defining, creating and delivering **information products** for the safe, ==efficient and effective use of products== (technical systems, software, services). - TEKOM  
- (ASTC) You are part of the technical communication world if your role includes creating or supporting:  
	- Technical information in any format, including printed, electronic, mobile, online help  
	- Information of any sort, such as procedures, work instructions, manuals, user guides, training, parts information  
	- Procedures and instructions for business  
	- Learning material (information design) and training content for print, electronic, or online use  
	- Compliance based information that aligns with standards, legislation, and codes of practice  
	- User experience, workflow analysis, design, and usability test.


### Why is it important?
- We all deal with complex systems at home and at work – from computers to cars, consumer products to business procedures. The need for accurate and accessible documentation to explain them has never been greater. – (ISTC)  

- If people cannot use a product or service, or cannot find out how to solve problems they might come across, they are less likely to use or buy it. This means organisations need to create and manage content that guides users. – (ISTC)  

### Primary mandate
A good technical communicator is always thinking about the end-user, how they will access and interpret information, and the most suitable presentation format. (ASTC)

### 10 Laws of good report writing
https://www.theiet.org/media/5182/technical-report-writing.pdf
1. Produce the report for your reader(s)  
2. Keep the report as short as possible  
3. Organise information for the convenience of the reader  
4. Include accurate references  
5. Ensure your writing is accurate, concise and straightforward  
6. Include diagrams with the right labels in the right place for your reader  
7. Make sure your summary gives the whole picture in brief  
8. Check the report for technical errors, typing errors and inconsistency  
9. Consider design as well as content  
10. Produce the report for your reader(s)

### Standard Operating procedures (SOPs)
- Example:  [SOP of Centrifugal Pumps](https://techproces.com/standard-operating-procedure-sop/)  
- Note the need for organisation, ‘hierarchy’ and ‘layering’ of information.  
- Summary, as well as detail

### Patents
A very high level technical document that also requires exceptional writing skills.  
• USPTO – [How to draft a patent](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/P2AP_PartIV_Learnhowtodraftapatentapplication_Final_0.pdf)  
• IP Australia has some [useful templates](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/patents/how-to-apply-for-a-standard-patent/how-to-write-a-specification-for-my-patent-application)  
• Interesting read – [Patents that change the world](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/design/g20051677/patents-changed-the-world/)

### Business Case
- Value Proposition  
- Key Partners and Key Activities  
- Customer segments and relationships  
- Cost structure  
- Revenue streams  
- B2B – B2C  
- [Better Business Cases](https://www.treasury.govt.nz/information-and-services/state-sector-leadership/investment-management/better-business-cases-bbc)

### Reports to Government
- Complex in the sense that it is more than ‘merely technical’  
- Good to have ‘systems thinking’ approach
