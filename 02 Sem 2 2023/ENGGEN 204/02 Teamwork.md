### Significance of Group Work
- We find that interacting groups are as fast as the fastest individual and more efficient than the most efficient individual for complex tasks but not for simpler ones.   
- We find that interacting groups generate more solutions more rapidly and explore the solution space more broadly than independent problem solvers, finding higher-quality solutions than all but the highest-scoring individuals.

`Almaatouq, A., Alsobay, M., Yin, M., & Watts, D. J. (2021). Task complexity moderates group  synergy. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118(36), https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101062118`  

This study used functional MRI to observe the brain activity of group members and individuals when solving problems. 

It illustrated that a group is more than the sum of its members in terms of brain activity. 

The social mode of the brain could be described as a reconfiguration, leading to different parts of the brain interacting differently when working in a group. 

#### To group or not to group
- The performance of a small group in problem solving may differ from the aggregated individual performances of all group members or the most productive group member working alone (Lorge et al., 1958; Hill, 1982; Laughlin et al., 2006).  
- Groups may systematically outperform or underperform any of these baselines (Kerr and Tindale, 2004) demonstrating group gain (“group superiority effect”) or group loss, respectively.
- A seminal study by Woolley et al. (2010) suggested that small groups may be treated as collective subjects with their own level of collective intelligence, and that this level does not correlate with either the average or the best individual intelligence of the group members, but may be predicted by gender, average social sensitivity, and in-group discussion style.

#### Inter Brain synchrony
Some studies show that  people’s brain activity becomes synchronised with others’ (inter- brain synchrony) during social engagement

#### Group work engineering
In engineering, we deal with **complex problems**, and we require **systems thinking** (seeing the larger picture). We also need **Interdisciplinary** where Engineers of different specialisations working together. 

> If it can be solved by one person – then you don’t need an engineer!
#### Signs of an effective team

- Communication  
- Leadership  
- Contribution/ Equal workload  
- Time-management  
- Respect  
- Accountability  
- Helping each other  
- Inclusiveness  
- Organisation and Planning  
- Flexibility/Open minded/listening  
- Plan  
- Defined roles  
- Giving and receiving feedback  
- Resolving problems  
- Goals  
- Friendly


### Team Life Cycle
Tuckman's stages of team life cycle
- Forming
- Storming
- Norming
- Performing
- Adjourning

	“I hit on four stages going from (1) orientation/testing/dependence, to (2) conflict, to (3) group cohesion, to (4) functional role-relatedness. For these I coined the terms: forming, storming, norming, and performing - terms that would come to be used to describe developing groups for the next 20 years and which probably account for the paper's popularity.” -Bruce Tuckman, 2001

#### Forming
In the first stage people get together, its really about discovering the boundaries of the task and your teammates
- Orientations
- Testing
- Dependance

#### Storming
Everyone wants to express their individuality, there will be conflict, infighting
- Resistance
- Conflict
- Emotional Demand

#### Norming
Getting out of that previous stage - Very Important! The emotions have to be managed. Theres an openness and flexibility, your not rooted to your opinion. 
- ﻿﻿Openness
- ﻿﻿Flexibility
- ﻿﻿Functionality
- ﻿﻿Equilibrium

#### Preforming
Everyone is supporting each other, there is a group energy. 
- ﻿﻿Constructive action
- ﻿﻿Supportive structure
- ﻿﻿Group energy
- ﻿Whole is greater than the mere sum of parts


### Dysfunctions of a team
Patrick Lencioni's 5 dysfunctions
- ﻿Absence of Trust
- ﻿﻿Fear of Conflict
- ﻿﻿Lack of Commitment
- ﻿﻿Avoidance of Accountability
- ﻿﻿Inattention to Result
#### Trust
The need to display **vulnerability**
- Share your failure stories,
- Celebrate someone else's superiority
- Show a willingness to learn from someone else
- Demonstrate humility 
- Provide safety
- Decide on the *rules of engagement*

An example is that there could be someone in the group that has problems getting up in the morning, and doesn't trust the team to tell them that mornings are not a good time for them to meet. 
#### Embrace useful conflict
Conflict can be a good thing, leading to new ideas
- No fear
- Based on trust
- Productive, is useful
- Conflict is the pursuit of truth
- Ability to disagree with respect and collegiality

One person in a team might disagree with someone on a moral issue. How can you come past that and work out a solution
#### Commitment
This also involves being reliable, having an ongoing commitment to the group. There can be many reasons for a lack of commitment and it is important to work out what they are. 
- Engage and weigh in
- Engage in the conflict
- Active participation in a group
- Don't be passive
#### Accountability
Sometimes we tend not to hold people accountable for their bad behaviour because we don't want to create a conflict. This is bad. 

- ﻿﻿Accountable - for behaviour - what one says and does
	- ﻿﻿E.g. call people out for bad behaviour, and don't hide behind anonymity.
- ﻿﻿Need to be committed to accountability
- ﻿﻿Peer accountability
	- ﻿﻿Be accountable
	- ﻿﻿Hold others accountable 


#### Attention to results
There is a argument about subjectivity and objectivity. Are you going to stick to your view when you realise your wrong. 
- ﻿Results are the focus
- ﻿﻿Accountability to the results
- ﻿﻿Group objectives are most important
- ﻿﻿Let go of ego

### Group work
#### In the academic setting
In this particular scenario, these are some things that come into play when trying to achieve high results. 
- ﻿﻿Team vs Group
- ﻿﻿Type of task
- ﻿﻿Free Riding and the Sucker Effect
- ﻿﻿Altruism versus self-interest
- ﻿﻿Influences on likelihood of free-riding
- ﻿﻿Complex vs Easy tasks
- ﻿﻿Optimising vs Maximising outcomes
- ﻿﻿Recognition for effort
- ﻿﻿Group size

#### Team vs Group 
*The whole being greater than the sum of the parts*
- ﻿﻿Depends on the nature of the work or task
- ﻿﻿Teams generally have more complex and longer term projects

#### Type of task
There are three types of task
- ﻿﻿Disjunctive
	- ﻿﻿A type of task that can only be done by one person
- ﻿﻿Conjunctive
	- ﻿﻿A type of task that has many parts and each part is taken up by a team member. Each part is not connected to another, but the whole task is a combination of the parts.
- ﻿﻿Additive
	- ﻿﻿Similar to conjunctive, except that in this case the different parts are purposely connected and interdependency is an attribute.

#### Free riding / the sucker effect
- ﻿Free Riding: "The problem of the non-performing group member who reaps the benefits of the accomplishments of the remaining group members with little or no cost to him/herself"
- ﻿﻿The Sucker effect refers to individuals responding to others free-riding upon their efforts by free-riding themselves
- ﻿﻿"inequity-based motivation loss" where capable students reduce their input into a project when they experience free-riding .
- ﻿﻿Competent students are less likely to think of themselves as suckers if they genuinely feel that they are covering for a member of the group who is unlikely to succeed by themselves.
- ﻿﻿Thus, one way of minimising the sucker effect is to allow members of groups to "get to know each other better".
#### Altruism vs Self interest
The more powerful motivation is for students to maximise their self-interest and to obtain high grades at the expense of others in the group.

There are two main motivations
- ﻿﻿Intrinsic
	- ﻿﻿Selfless commitment to the task
	- ﻿﻿Inherent selflessness and empathetic to team mates
- ﻿﻿Extrinsic
	- ﻿﻿External incentives
	- ﻿﻿Marks and grades
	- ﻿﻿Equitable effort - fair distribution of workload
#### Complexity vs easy tasks
The more complex a task, the less freeriding that is likely to occur. 
- ﻿﻿Task complexity $\propto$ 1/likelihood of free-riding
- ﻿﻿However increased task complexity = difficulty to assess individual contribution
- ﻿﻿Easy tasks - risk of 'loafing'
- ﻿﻿Lack of challenge
- ﻿﻿Lack of clarity
#### Optimising vs maximising outcomes
Maximising tasks are much less likely to be beset by problems such as "free-riding" simply because they are clearer in terms of outcomes and less ambiguous (Strong and Anderson 1990)

Optimisation: Success is determined by the proximity of the finished product to a desired final outcome
- ﻿﻿i.e., work produced is compared to a regulative "ideal"
- ﻿﻿There is a degree of ambiguity in the outcomes.
- ﻿E.g. "Here is the task, do the best you can - I will then assess"

Maximising outcomes, by contrast, are measured by unambiguous goals achieved
- ﻿﻿e.g., in terms of rate or quantity or speed attained in producing the final outcome.
- ﻿﻿E.g. "Here is the task, you have three days to work on it, here is what is expected, go to it - I will then assess after three days"
#### Recognition of effort
Identification of individual effort.
- ﻿﻿The harder it is to tell "who did what" in an assignment, the greater the chances of loafing by group members.
	- ﻿﻿Peer appraisals may help
	- ﻿﻿Should it be anonymous or not

### The team charter
A vital step in the fomration of a team. A well-designed charter helps to clarify expectations, focus activities, and provide a basis for decision-making.

Parts of a good team charter:
- 1. Group members
- 2. Core values
- 3. Communication
- 4. Roles
- 5. Metrics of success
- 6. Standards of quality

1. Negotiation is the discussion between people that are trying react an agreement
2. Refers to the process to reach an agreement, compromise refers to the end of the process where there is an agreement and harmony. 
3. Negotiation involves skills and tactic.
4. Requires careful consideration of the right people, place, issues, way, time

### Successful Negotiation
To successfully negotiate, you need the following communication skills:
- ﻿﻿Preparation.
- ﻿﻿The right balance between talking and listening.
- ﻿﻿Body language.
- ﻿﻿Speaking effectively.
#### Preparation
If there is an opportunity to negotiate, use it. 
- Build scenarios
- Anticipate questions
- Prepare responses

#### Balance between talking and listening
- ﻿Negotiation involves asking the right questions and providing the right responses when asked and this process is two-way.
- ﻿﻿To provide the right response and ask the right question, one must be able to listen and understand

#### Speaking effectively
It is extremely advantageous that the content of your speech has structure, is logical, defensible, is simple and contains examples and metaphors.

- **Structure**: Tell them what you are going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what you told them. People tend to remember the first and last thing they have heard and to tune out the middle part.
- ﻿﻿**Logic**: Make sure your message logically explains what you want and why. Consider all arguments.
- ﻿﻿**Defensible**: Successful negotiators know to be prepared for the counter-argument and are normally excited about this part of the negotiation.
- ﻿﻿**Simplicity**: The best arguments are also the simplest. If your case is too complicated, you will lose either their interest or their understanding, or both. Remember the KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid!  
- **Examples**: Give plenty of examples and anecdotes. Draw a mental picture in the other party's mind

#### Getting into sync
There are three types of personalities that you need to gel with for successful negotiation
- Results oriented
- Relationship based
- Rational inclined

You need to figure out what kind of situation you are in and then make the most of it. 

##### Identifying Types of people
The following tables contain the types of words that each of these people might use.

#### Interest based negotiation - Exercise
- ﻿﻿Position: each of the parties wants the orange.
- ﻿﻿Interests: none of the parties is interested in cutting up the orange.  
- Needs: the reason why each party needs the orange is not the same.
	- Party (A) needs the pulp to make a cake, 
	- Party (B) needs the juice for a drink  
	- Party (C) needs the rind in order to decorate the cake

Here there exists a solution where everyones needs can be met.

This leads to **interest based negotiation**

In any situation involving different positions, problem-solving requires the needs of the parties to be identified. These needs may well be underlying the apparent interests at stake. Analysing the underlying needs will enable the problem to be solved in a mutually beneficial manner.


#### Negotiation is everywhere
![[Pasted image 20230805124233.png | center | 400]]



### Perspectives and Empathy
Perspective taking and empathising with the other party can be advantageous for negotiation. Perspective taking is a cognitive response that involves imagining yourself in "someone else's shoes" (Batson et al., 2003) or entertaining the point of view of others (Davis, 1983b)

**Perspective taking** is when the negotiator focuses on the thoughts and interests of their counterpart, while **empathy** focuses on their counterpart's emotions and feelings.

Both are important and a balance is required, as both can be complementary. 

For example, considering an opponent's thoughts helps a negotiator win money and resources, but considering an opponent's feelings helps a negotiator avoid harmful breaches of ethics!.

#### Things to watch out for
- ﻿ETHICAL CONUNDRUMS
- ﻿﻿UNETHICAL BARGAINING

- Competitive Bargaining
- Attacking your opponent
- ﻿﻿Making false promises
- ﻿﻿Misrepresentation
- ﻿﻿Inappropriate information gathering
- ﻿﻿Feigning emotions

You essentially just need a strong ethical foundation
##### Competitive Bargaining
Making an extremely high opening offer; making the other party feel as though they are under time pressure and you are not.

Putting cash in front of the needy is probably not good, it will make them feel compelled. 
##### Attacking your opponent
- Attempting to get your opponent fired or threatening to make your opponent look weak.
##### Making false Promises
- ﻿promise concessions that you will not provide;
- ﻿﻿promise that your constituency will uphold an agreement that you know they will not

"Don't worry, sign up, you can always cancel" - nobody answers the phone when they try to cancel
##### Misrepresentation
- ﻿e.g., Intentionally misrepresenting information to your opponent in order to strengthen your negotiating arguments or position
- ﻿﻿Intentionally misrepresenting the progress of negotiations to your constituency in order to make your own position appear stronger  
- Feigning ignorance
##### Inappropriate Information Gathering
- Attempting to gain information about your opponent through expensive gifts, paying mutual friends and contacts, and recruiting your opponent's colleagues or teammates

##### Feigning Emotion
 - Strategic misrepresentation of positive emotion
 - Feign liking, sympathy, and caring.

### Compromise
While negotiation gets one to an agreement, the extent to which that agreement benefits the parties can depend on the extent to which either party has compromised. 

A total compromise may instead be a full concede, while a partial compromise may be seen to facilitate cooperation - hence the extent and range of compromise, and the situation in which it is affected, defines it.

One side may give in (full concede) or there might be a middle ground found (partial compromise)

- **Compromise** is an agreement made between two people or groups in which each side gives up some of the things they want so that both sides are happy at the end.

#### When to compromise
A compromise is made when there is a need to resolve an issue and no one solution is accepted. 

The issue requiring compromise is typically called a 'conflict' and conflict resolution is a huge area of interest as there is obviously both academic and practical value. 

Compromise is one way of **conflict resolution**, the others being aggression (or competing), avoidance, accommodation (as in conceding), and collaboration.

There are 5 main methods for conflict resolution. These are:
- Compromise
- Agression (competing)
- Avoidance
- Accommodation (conceding)
- Collaboration

![[Pasted image 20230805130251.png | center  | 400]]

####  Ukraine vs Russia conflict
There has always been bad blood between the two states. 
- 1919 Soviet invasion of Ukraine
- The Holodomor (1932 - 1933)

- The 1954 transfer of Crimea to Ukraine by USSR Communist Party first secretary Nikita Khrushchev
	- Since Sevastopol in Crimea was the site of the Black Sea Fleet, a quintessential element of Soviet and then of Russian foreign policy, the transfer had the intended effect of binding Ukraine inexorably to Russia, "Eternally Together", as a poster commemorating the event proclaimed.
- The transfer was declared illegitimate by the Russian legislature in May 1992, which was in turn disputed by Ukraine's parliament.
- ﻿﻿The US supported Ukraine's bid to join NATO launched in January 2008 as an effort to obtain a NATO Membership Action Plan. Russia strongly opposed any prospect of Ukraine becoming a NATO member.  
- In February and March 2014, Russia invaded and subsequently annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine.  
	- Ukraine responded with sanctions against Russia as well as blacklisting and freezing assets of numerous individuals and entities involved with the annexation.  
    - Ukraine started a campaign not to buy Russian products.

- On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine.

This is a good example of when to choose which sort of conflict resolution
#### Choosing resolution method
When you feel like you are going to loose the conflict, or if the outcome of the conflict is irrelevant. It is a good idea to **Concede.**

Avoiding conflict is different to avoid action to address an existing conflict. 

The correct choice is depending on the stakes of the conflict. 


### Compromise
#### Condition of compromise
- ﻿Pareto optimality
- ﻿﻿That even though both sides 'give up something' it is understood that by not doing so there is more to lose.
- ﻿﻿That in the end, the compromise is an improvement on the status quo

Doing something is better than doing nothing

#### Compromise vs Collaborate
The difference between compromise and collaborate, is that the former refers to a 'giving up' of a thing from both parties, while the latter considers a suitable way forward that benefits both parties. 

Ideally **collaboration** is the most beneficial but requires effort and ingenuity to create new opportunity from the problem of conflict.

**Compromise** will require careful consideration on the thing to give up, resolving the conflict. 

Having a clear understanding of one's own 'big picture' strategy is important in order to make the right decision on what to give up and how.

#### Shallow vs Deep Compromise
Shallow: Based on bartering and trading
Deep: Compromise that has the mutual modification of ends and principals at its core

Example of **deep compromise**: "Being completely free of fossil fuels by 2030"
One group completely supports it and other is hesitant.

To find a compromise will involve groups changing their core values around the use of fossil fuels. 

Examples of compromise here include a longer time frame and a % reduction rather than a complete reduction. 

There is an argument that *The deeper the compromise, the more meaningful it is*

##### Deep compromise 
- It is good but requires effort, ingenuity, and resolve. 
- The underpinning ideals and principles have to be adaptable, to be fused with others into
new versions. 
- The result is trust and respect, friendship and collegiality.
