### The washing accord
A multi-lateral agreement between bodies responsible for accreditation or recognition of tertiary-level engineering qualifications within their jurisdictions who have chosen to work collectively to assist the mobility of professional engineers.

It also establishes and benchmarks the standard for professional engineering education across those bodies

- Originally signed in 1989, the Washington Accord, is a multi-lateral agreement between bodies responsible for accreditation or recognition of tertiary-level engineering qualifications within their jurisdictions who have chosen to work collectively to assist the mobility of professional engineers.
- As with the other accords the signatories are committed to development and recognition of good practice in engineering education.
- The activities of the Accord signatories (for example in developing exemplars of the graduates’ profiles from certain types of qualification) are intended to assist  growing globalisation of mutual recognition of engineering qualifications. The Washington Accord is specifically focused on academic programmes which deal with the practice of engineering at the professional level.
- The Accord outlines the mutual recognition, between the participating bodies, of accredited engineering degree programmes. It also establishes and benchmarks the standard for professional engineering education across those bodies.

#### Cool Questions
You know your employee is *getting it* when you can answer yes to all these questions

**Execute**  
- Do they complete all parts of their assignments?  
- Do they complete them on time?  
- Do they complete them at or close to your standard of quality?  

**Synthesise**  
- Can they identify all the important insights?  
- Do they exclude all unimportant insights?  
- Do they accurately assess the relative importance of the important insights?  
- Can they communicate the important insights clearly and succinctly?

**Recommend**  
- Do they always provide a recommendation when asking you questions instead of relying on you to come up with answers?  
- Do they demonstrate appreciation for the potential downsides of their recommendation?  
- Do they consider alternatives before landing on a recommendation?  
- Are their recommendations backed by strong, sensible reasoning?  

**Generate**  
- Do they propose high-value work that doesn’t follow logically from work they are already doing?  
- Can they convert your and others’ visions into feasible plans for realizing those visions?  
- Can they figure out how to answer questions you have but don’t know how to answer?
