Making decisions, getting answers to questions that are not that straight forward. 

### Importance of Decision making skills
Decision making helps us get from being in a situation of not knowing to knowing.
- ﻿﻿Situations could be that of not knowing what to do, what to choose or maybe even what to think.

When there are consequences from our decision making, that can add pressure onto the need to make the right' decision.

Decision making comes into play when we need to generate, evaluate, or organise ideas, formulate important criteria for measuring outcomes or success, plan and analyse processes, and reduce complexity in large multifactorial problems.

Decision Making, Optimisation, Quality/work, Improvement, Problem Solving for:
- ﻿﻿Generating and organising ideas
- ﻿﻿Determining important criteria  
- Evaluating ideas
- ﻿﻿Analysing processes
- ﻿﻿Determining root causes
- ﻿﻿Risk assessments
- ﻿﻿Planning
- ﻿﻿Data-handling
- ﻿﻿Statistics and experimental design

### Challenges in complex problem solving
For when there are problems like having too many variables;
- What are the variables?
- How to decide which are important?
- What are their inter dependance?

#### Tools
- ﻿Fishbone diagram
- ﻿﻿Pareto Chart
- ﻿﻿SWOT analysis
- ﻿﻿Decision matrix
- ﻿﻿Decision Tree

##### Fishbone Diagram
- ﻿When identifying possible causes for a problem
- ﻿When a team's thinking tends to fall into rut
- 
1. ﻿Agree on a problem statement
2. ﻿﻿﻿Brainstorm the major categories of causes of the problem.
3. ﻿﻿﻿Write the categories of causes as branches from the main arrow.
4. ﻿﻿﻿Brainstorm all the possible causes of the problem.  
    Ask "Why does this happen?"
5. ﻿﻿﻿Make sure step 4 is thorough - ask again - add layers if needed.
6. ﻿﻿﻿When the group runs out of ideas, focus attention to places on the chart where ideas are few

##### Pareto Chart  
- ﻿﻿When analysing data about the frequency of problems or causes in a process
- ﻿When there are many problems or causes and you want to focus on the most significant
- ﻿When analysing broad causes by looking at their specific components
- ﻿﻿When communicating with others about your data

1. ﻿﻿﻿Decide what categories you will use to group items.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Decide what measurement is appropriate.
3. ﻿﻿﻿Decide what period of time the Pareto chart will cover.
4. ﻿﻿﻿Collect the data..
5. ﻿﻿﻿Subtotal the measurements for each category.
6. ﻿﻿﻿Determine the appropriate scale for the measurements you have collected.
7. ﻿﻿﻿Construct and label bars for each category. Place the tallest at the far left, and so on.

##### SWOT Analysis
Used to formulate and analyse strategies

##### Decision Matrix
Similar to other multi criteria processes
- ﻿When a list of options must be narrowed to one choice
- ﻿When the decision must be made on the basis of several criteria
- ﻿﻿After a list of options has been reduced to a manageable number by list reduction

1. ﻿Brainstorm the evaluation criteria and list of options appropriate to the situation.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Assign a relative weight to each criterion
3. ﻿﻿﻿Draw an L-shaped matrix. Write the criteria and their weights as labels along one edge and the list of options along the other edge.
4. ﻿﻿﻿Evaluate each option against the criteria. (Establish a rating scale for each criterion.)
5. ﻿﻿﻿Multiply each option's rating by the weight. Add the points for each option. The option with the highest score will not necessarily be the one to choose, but the relative scores can generate meaningful discussion and lead the team toward consensus

##### Decision Tree
- ﻿Useful for evaluating the outcomes of **different decision possibilities**
- ﻿﻿Action and possible consequence
- ﻿﻿Action refers to the decision chosen
- ﻿﻿'Possible' refers to probability
- ﻿﻿Consequence could be in terms of \$\$ profit or loss

A Decision Tree is an extremely useful to lavout a problem and all the possible pathways or solutions and also include the odds and likelihood of success or failure. 
The tree also requires the input of information of the expected outcomes, and hence keeps clearly on the page the goal of the problem-solving exercise and its
objectives.
###### Example
- ﻿The consequences of a decision is predicted.
- ﻿﻿In this example the question is: In order to create a new product, should the company invest in significant R&D or should it do a less costly improvement?  
    Each decision point is represented as a square.
- ﻿﻿If a decision can result in more than one outcome, a chance node is introduced (circle).
- ﻿﻿At this chance node, the probability of each outcome
- Is stated.
- ﻿﻿From some chance nodes, a further decision may be needed (e.g. node 2A)
- ﻿At the far end to the right is the final payoff in dollars.

This entire map is drawn left to right, with respect to a timescale from 2, 3, 5, and up to 18 years

###### Solutions
The solutions map, to the decision tree, is a result of analysing the numbers in the decision tree.

E is the 'expected value' for a decision.

So at each decision node in the earlier decision tree, some idea of the \$ value of a decision may be obtained.

To do this, the following is done:

$$
E = \sum_{i} P_{i}C_{i} - \sum_{j}I_{j}
$$
where $P_{i}$ and $C_{i}$ are respectively the probability of individual event and its payoff, and I, is the investment. The way to calculate is to go from right to left and calculate the expected value for each decision node, one by one.

**Should that company invest in R&D?**

The risk here overall is $2.755M, Maybe this is too high for this company?

#### Example of applying tools
Choosing a material for a project:

A SWOT analysis forces the group to think about the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats in relation to the overall strategy and capabilities of the organisation. 

So, in the example case introduced in the previous page, a SWOT analysis of the tube design and manufacturing in relation to the material used, may look like this.
![[Pasted image 20230805135219.png | center | 400]]

We can then use the outcome of the swag analysis to form the criteria of the decision matrix. 
![[Pasted image 20230805135444.png | center | 400]]
Each of the options, may be rated against each of the criterion, from a score of 1 - 5, with 5 being the most positive rating. The weighting factors here are based on the SWOT analysis as well, and is used to multiply the rating factor scores, to obtain a final Decision factor score.

##### Outcomes
The strength of the decision matrix is dependent on the effort and intelligence put into determining the options, criteria, weighting, and rating. 

Typically, a collaborative set of individuals working on the problem and brainstorming on these factors will provide the best decision making. 

Such metrics-based processes for decision making also helps validates decisions, and if done collaboratively, can serve to justify a final decision in a democratic manner. 

If the group starts the collaboration with very diverse views, going through the process of a SWOT analysis followed by a Decision Matrix analysis, can bring a diverse group to converge on solving the problem effectively.
