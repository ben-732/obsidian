For the purposes of this thing, mans is just an administrator for a gallery

### Gap in market
Bring real good business into the virtual space. 

Representing local Auckland and kiwi artists to sell their art in an online setting. 

### Regulations / Standards
Limitations: Only want to sell art to people 16 and older
focus on a New Zealand audience and NZ laws. Long term overseas expansion


### Current challenges or pain points
The company does not sell art online at the moment. Company is in newmarket, people have to come into their venue. They have limited spaces and the auctions are at specific times. Art is sold in person at physical auctions at the moment. 

### What flaws would make this product a failure
==Something==
A for profit company, that has bills and wants to succeed. 

### Taking money from artists
They take a commission for the service that is provided

### Relationship with artists
Artists come to the company who take a small cut for their services. we are just dealing with the administrator for the gallery, we don't have to interact with the client in any way. 

### Important elements to communicate
Big pictures would be great, descriptions too
Information about the artist that created it - profile pages

*I kind of imagine trade me*
some stuff fixed price, some stuff on auction

### Different kinds of users
administrators???, Viewers, buyers

### Concerns or considerations to consider legitimacy
In terms of us acquiring the art, the process won't be changed. the gallery will handle it

Selling side of the art, the people who are buying the art should be legitimate
The bid needs to be legitimate, there needs to be a validated payment method in order to be able to bid or buy. 

### Target demographic and characteristics
The people that come into the art gallery is normally 20 to 25

The gallery has a goal to expand there business to a wider range of people.

They have no particular demographic in terms of gender, ethnicity etc. 

### Currency
Start NZD but be able to expand so being able to take other currencies would be beneficial. 

Most commonly used payment methods should all be implemented for international  growth
### What is art
- Paintings - one of a kind
- Prints - reproductions of a painting
- Sculptured art

Not all of this art needs to be sold online, the exhibition need 

### Forum? Comments
Sounds good, helps promote the art.
Needs sharing features

### What sorts of details 
Name, artist name, price, date, 

Nothing else specific comes to mind, if you were going to sell the piece of art, an auction might need other pieces of information like current bidders. 

### Methods of sale
Fixed price, a feature to make an offer could be useful but wouldn't be a top priority. 
Auctions

### Verification
The gallery verifies the artist and uploads art. 

The artist page can show more art

### Methods of auction
Starts and has some form of end date
Needs a reserve price feature. They wouldn't want to sell the art if it is below a certain point. 

### Searching and filtering options
Sorting by price, date of production, artists produced etc

Filter buy now, auction etc. style location etc etc

### Authentication
developers should take care of it on a technical level. 

Verified email feature at minimum. Users should be held responsible for their actions on the website. 

### Problems to solve

### Paywall
They would be open to it but further down the line

### Features
They want to be able to promote their art as well as sell it. 
The Auckland Art Gallery has a website that does a good job of promoting their art in a nice way. 

### Promotion of gallery
Still want to promote in gallery exhibitions, gallery news, etc

### Price range of art
Mostly between $50 and \$150. Payment methods would help improve the turnover of the business. 

### Sold listings
Does not apply to prints
Paints should be able to still be displayed but tagged as sold, still displayable in exhibitions etc
